    <h3><span>Title: </span>NewYear Countdown Timer</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>Countdown timer is a webpage that will show you the days, hours, minutes and seconds to the new year.

You can easily set the date and time for the event you want to countdown to and start the timer from anywhere from 1 minute to 99 days.
